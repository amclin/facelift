Facelift Image Replacement (FLIR)


Facelift was originally created by Cory Mawhorter, however the site hosting the project went
offline and the source code is no longer available.

This is essentially a fork then, based on the latest copy of FLIR that I had access to, v1.2.
FLIR is licensed under GPL 2.0. If Cory reaches out, I'm happy to grant ownership to him again.

=============================================================================================


Originally, I created Facelift Image Replacement because I didn't like sIFR but still wanted the 
ability to add custom fonts to my websites.  Since then, I've added a lot more functionality and 
FLIR has been downloaded upwards of 7000 times as of this writing.  

If you appreciate FLIR and the time that went into creating it, the plug-ins, the documentation, 
and providing support via the forums, than please think about making a small contribution to the 
project.  

Thank you for downloading FLIR and I hope you find it as useful as I do.

Sincerely,
Cory Mawhorter
